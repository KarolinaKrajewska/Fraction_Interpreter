# Fraction_Interpreter
This program does simple operations on fractions that are supplied in proper format. It is supposed to be ran from the terminal with piping the input from a text file. I wrote this for my Data Structures class assignment at my second year at Bard College, and then extended it (added Comparable interface) as part of my moderation project.
The input (TestFile.txt) consists of fractions in the following format: ( numerator / denominator ) . It Is important to note that brackets, numbers and operators have to be separated by a space for the program to work properly, as the function readString() is used.
The program keeps track of what elements are in the input by mantaining two stacks - one for integers (vals) and one for operators (ops). Each integer and operator enountered during parsing is pushed into their respective stack. When a right bracket ')' is encountered, the values are popped from the stacks and appropriate operations are done on them appropriately.
I use BigInteger data type, so that the upper limit for the number is set higher than in case of regular int. I also use a package from Data Structures textbook (algs4.jar)
