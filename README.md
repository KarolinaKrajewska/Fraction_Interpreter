# Fraction_Interpreter
This program does simple operations on fractions that are supplied in proper format. I wrote for a Data Structures class assignment, and then extended it (added
Comparable interface) as part of my moderation project.
The input (TestFile.txt) consists of fractions in the following format: ( numerator / denominator ) . It Is important to note that brackets, numbers and operators 
have to be separated by a space for the program to work properly, as the function readString() is used.
